## Oh my gosh!
I was playing this game for over hours, this is not even a game, just shoot the ball and breaking the piles of boxes.
Simple game and no brains needed.
I found this from tutorials, learn Three.js Ammo.js physics collision detects.
and now I am playing it. I like it. Good for having a break time.
